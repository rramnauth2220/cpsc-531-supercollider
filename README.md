# CPSC 531 Supercollider Notes & Homeworks

**10-07-2019 Notice:** The purpose of this repository is to more easily share and discuss my work in CPSC 431/531 with current students. After this Fall 2019 semester, this repo will become private so as to protect the integrity of the assignments and future students' work.
